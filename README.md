# STOCKCHECK-PS5-
## Why a StockCheck?
I created this stockchecker for PS5's because I was in need of a little extra cash flow so I had to resort to reselling. 
Because the PlayStation 5 was in such high demand there was no way I'd be able to continuosly manually check the current stock
of the console. Therefore, I went ahead and programmed a stock checker.

## What does it do?
It scrapes the website using a combination of BeautifulSoup4 and ChromeDriver.
It's able to identify the stock availability by using HTML and CSS elements
as guides.

## Can it only do the PlayStation 5 Console ?
No! All you need to do is alter the links at the bottom of the code
and add the links to the product you would like a stock check on!
